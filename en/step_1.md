## Introduction

In this project you'll learn how to use a variety of basic electronic components with an Arduino compatible micro-controller. You'll use the Arduino IDE to write the code to control and receive data from these components. 

### What you will make

You'll then combine a number of these components to build an ultrasonic proximity parking sensor that will produce an alert when an obstacle gets too close.


### What you will learn

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum){:target="_blank"}:
