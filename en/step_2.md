## What you will need

### Hardware

+ An Arduino compatible micro-controller with a serial interface (e.g. Arduino Uno, Leonardo, Adafruit Feather).
+ A computer to write the code and upload it to the Arduino (any Windows, mac or Linux computer (including a Raspberry Pi) will do).
+ An USB cable to connect the Arduino to your computer.
+ A breadboard
+ A buzzer
+ A Button
+ An HC-SR04 ultrasonic range finder sensor
+ Two LEDs
+ Three 220 ohm resistors
+ Some jumper wires
+ A temperature sensor

### Software

+ [The Arduino IDE software](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software?)

If you are using a Raspberry Pi, make sure you install the latest version from the download page above. Although the Arduino IDE is available though the *apt* package manager, it is a very old version.
