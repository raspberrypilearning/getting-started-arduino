## Introduction to Arduino

###Types of Arduino

Just like Raspberry Pi, Arduino is both the name of a computer company and their project: a single-board  micro-controller for building digital devices and interactive objects that can sense and control objects in the physical and digital world. The project's products are distributed as open-source hardware and software, which are licensed to allow anyone to manufacture Arduino boards.

There are lots of different types of Arduino. Many are based around the ATMega328 chip, although there are now lots of other varieties in use.

Official Arduino/Genuino models come in a range of sizes. from left to right: Leonardo, Uno, MKR Zero and Micro.
